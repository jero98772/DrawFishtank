#acuario_p5js drawing

this is for a science fair

that has the parameters or requirements to talk about representative authors in this case and their applications of the experiment

reprentaive authors talking about the 300 representative authors altogether less daniel shiffman than I have a book by daniel and euclides is a  big matheical who i can rely in he

299 of p5js and 1 that is eclides is a genius of geometry giving a know of some formulas starting from older to younger

#authors

euclides: * he lived in alejandria his life was little known and was or is the father of geometry and wrote some books called books that were almost as sold as the bible is believed to study in the school of Platon * and how it helps me project of the science fair * giving me the operations and basic formulas to be able to create new formulas like that of the classic fishtank so I call it and start from the beginning *

299 p5js contributors: * those people manage to work in a team correct improve create transformer with that library activating the will and not the duty and community work and contributions *

Daniel Shiffman: * works as a programmer and master of interactive telecommunication arts and has a BA in mathematics and philosophy and he has the idea to teach different things and graphically with challenges and make  visual helps (in codes in p5js) done things with p5js to teach *

#Applications

simulations: * I could take the code and use it to make simulations of life and the aquarium using the code like the book by Daniel Shiffman, a random code walker and see how the fish behave and then squeeze with an external stimulation *

Calular volume and modeling some forms: that is the anticipated purpose in 3D figures inclyebdo * cube side ^ 3 * * rectangular prism (height) (base) (depth) * * classical fishbowl (2piR (r ^ 2) / 2) + ( pi(R ^ 2)h) where h = height r = the excess of the circle to center  R = the range of the center the border of the figure and these figures are divided by 1000 because they give in cm ^ 3 *

Reliable purchase method: * If a customer wants an aquarium and does not know if what he wants long, short, tall, small this program allows some aquariums to deal with how to do 3D without ornaments but if he is going to say the volume in most of the cases *

teach and create: * it may happen that someone else comes down to see what he has and do something with him and create with something or use it for something and with that he learns from something *
